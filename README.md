# Practicing interacting with an API using fetch

Used the PokeAPI to get some data, and then display it on screen using pure JS, CSS and HTML.

It's not much, but it works, and it was a great thing to practice! :D

## To Do:

- Header
- Footer
- Fix numerical ordered cards issue
- Add pagination
- Add sorting
